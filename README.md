S.I.M.P.L.E. is :  **S**ervices for **I**nformation and **M**edia **P**ayments, **L**egitimacy and **E**ncryption
## PAYWALL
-- Smart-contract system that lives apart from a) digital identity b) access management, and facilitates frictionless end-user experience when subscribing/consuming/paying for published content. We imagine three models 1) pay-as-you-go/budgeted spend 2) recurring subscription 3) Subsidized access
## SERVER-SIDE ENCRYPTION
-- Building a decentralized, serverless protocol to facilitate server-side encryption/decryption prior to storing on IPFS / Filecoin. Likely leveraging EVM or Ethereum-pinned Layer 2 for virtualization along with either Intel SGX / OpenEnclave for remote, trustless keygen + distribution.
## CONTENT AUTHENTICATION
-- Guarantee provenance and authenticity of delivered content using Hash-based Message Authentication Codes (HMAC) and/or a Zero-knowledge Scheme
